###Q1

I am Pengcheng Qi, He/Him

###Q2

"It can move, meaning it should have a speed variable to be multiplied with deltatime and the input vector for locomotion." and indeed I wrote that line in the Update() function for the bunny to move.

And in the plant seed method we need to access the transform/ coordinates of the bunny, and initiate the prefab at that coordinate. It also need to update the text so there's a _plantCountUI.UpdateSeeds in the function.

The plant is on top of the cat, so the sorting layer in the prefab should be 2 instead of 0.

The plant is a prefab containing a sprite and it indeed is just a plant sprite.
